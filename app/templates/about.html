I'm <b>Andrzej Michalski</b>, a Software Developer living in Tarn√≥w, Poland.

I work as Python Developer in Cervi Robotics,
where I am responsible for robotics backend service.

My interests are in Geoscience, Internet of Things and Web Development.

I am VIM "lover". VIM it is great tool and I try use it, if there is only possibility.
It is great tool and make my workflow fast and efficient. If we talk about efficiency,
I like upgrade my workflow to be more fast and more productive.

I like to work on my own projects with Raspberry Pi and Home Automation.

The job as Software Developer is great, because I can realize my thoughts and make it real.

Being Programmer is very physical demanding job. After work I am triathlete and rock climber.
I am also Rescuer in Polish Mountain Rescue Service (GOPR).

The last, but not least role in my life is being Father of Two's - two Sons and husband for my wife.
